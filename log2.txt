Bi-Weekly Log 2
CSCI 444

  I'm not quite sure how time has gone so quickly but as it stands I have now finished close to a full month of work at my summer internship. At this point in my internship I am continuing to learn about service buses and the many benefits that they provide. On top of this a have been working with my boss to implement new services for the company's service bus and so I have been learning how to set that up within Visual Studio so that our service will perform the correct actions when requested and also have the ability to communicate the results of those actions with other parts of the bus. Being introduced to service buses has been a great learning experience so far for me. That, coupled with a crash course lesson on C# and the .NET framework as well as WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) services I feel has really expanded my knowledge as a computer science major.
  Also within the last few weeks many of the tasks that my boss has assigned to me I have finished rather quickly and so I have taken the liberty of studying some other topics that interest me (my boss doesn't mind as long as I finish my work). So far I have been doing some reading on hash maps/tables and how clustering can affect look-up times drastically. Also something that was interesting was problem of hash collisions within hash maps. Because of the Birthday Paradox (which I learned about in CSCI 415 Computer Security), hash collisions are unavoidable. One trick to deal with these collisions is by using linked lists (which we learned about in CSCI 301) that are attached to each one of the individual buckets. Since amount of data entries being stored in one particular bucket should not be too great if we picked a good hash function, linked lists are a good option here because with a small number of nodes a linked list will not be too greatly hindered by its slow search time.
